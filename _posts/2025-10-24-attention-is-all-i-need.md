today's side quest will be focused on the following youtube video: [deep learning introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) by none other than openai founding member [karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/).

the goal here is to get my hands on the core paper [attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and hopefully have a crappy baby gpt.

off to work
