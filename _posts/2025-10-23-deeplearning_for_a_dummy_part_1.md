when in new york this summer i've stumbled upon the following book: [deep learning](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262537551/deep-learning/) by john d. kelleher. 

as i'm no expert, i would do whatever dummies do they: give in to their urges. and so i bought it. 

excited at first, i was convinced that this would be a perfect read for my flight back to the old continent. 

but hey i'm a dummy after all. 

no pages were turned during the flight but i got great news. i've finally decided to give it a try. today... almost 3 months after the purchase of said book. 

anyway. 

introduction to deep learning is perfect. i mean i've always been interested in what fuels our corporate world with such drive. hell i took my uni course with a simple objective: to understand how a computers work... 

so here i'm updating my software. 

my take away from the first few pages:

machine learning is the ability for a machine to infer functions based on the data.

in a dummy version, the sole purpose of training a model is to let the computer take on some inputs and infer the functions that basically make the answer possible. 

the goal is the functions. so for any set of inputs passed onto a function the function will return the same outputs 

here is the basic example from the book. given the below dataset:

- f(5,5) = 25
- f(57,1) = 57
- f(4,4) = 16
- f(2,2) = 04

what is f(x,y) = ?

deducing the function is quite simple: f(x,y) = x * y. and that concludes the training step.

at this stage we usually get a neural network model that encodes the discovered functions as machine gibberish aka code and the learning stops right here.

but since machine learning is useless without inference we give it new inputs (not used for training) with the goal to get an insight from the model. this output is where the magic occurs. 

but there are some caveats, how can one manage to train a model versatile enough to handle my super illogical prompts or what happens when the number of functions is equal or superior to our dataset ? 

i need to continue my read. 

but bear in mind that whatever you post create or share on the web is a food for a machine somewhere.
